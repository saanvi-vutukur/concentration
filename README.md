Welcome to Concentration!

The aim of the game is to remove all cards from the screen! Do so by matching cards of the same color and value. To make a match click on cards. They will flip over to reveal their face sides. If they match they will be removed from the screen and lower your score. If not, they will flip back over. There is a timer in the left hand corner to track your progress as you make matches, and the score in the right hand corner that tracks how many matches are left.

This version of Concentration is brought to you with the brand new Shrek deck! A fresh pack of 52 Shrek themed cards. Enjoy!

Stay concentrated to win the game as fast as possible! Good luck!
